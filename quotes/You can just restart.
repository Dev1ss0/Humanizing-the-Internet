One thing that your teachers never told you cause it would make you too powerful is you can just restart at any poin, you can just press restart and become a new person with new practises and new values, new habbits, new ideas.
It doesn't happen all at once but you can make the decision to become that person just by walking outside, playing a cathartic Spotify playlist that you know will is gonna charge you up and your neurochemicals take care of the rest.
Seriously, it't powerful, you can use it to your advantage, you could also, bacome the antagonist of the story but just don't do that just be the main characted and you know try to help someone out, have a good outlook on life.
But you don't have to be trapped in your own dysfunction, you don't need to stay in the spiraling bubble of your own thinking and limiting beliefs, you don't have to do that, if it's become boring, then you shouldn't.
You should probably go do something that's intresting, which is gonna be the unknown, which is gonna be scary but then you realise the challange and the things that scare you are actually exciting.
When you choose to be the character that takes them on is the working theory on this.
