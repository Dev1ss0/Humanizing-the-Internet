You know this feeling like you want to create something meaningful? I sure do, it's this motivational voice inside of me craving for creativity. Tho, you don't give the voice what it wants.
You are waiting for the "perfect moment" because you aren't where you are "supposed to be". Truth is, there is no such thing as a perfect moment.
I would even say that the perfect moment becomes the perfect moment when you realise there is no perfect moment.

Josh Czuba once said something along the lines of "What if you create it badly? Is it even possible?", he meant, what if you don't wait for the perfect moment and just create.
We are in this together and we got this.
