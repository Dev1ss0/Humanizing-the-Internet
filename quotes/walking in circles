The 21st century male experience, walking circles around an empty parking lot in a dress shirt because I can't be inside for another second or I'll lose my mind. 
This is what it is, you wear a brave face, you smile at every stranger you meet and you walk until your feet don't work anymore. Or until you gain your sanity.
You just shake it out, you wear a brave face, you eat a pound of lean ground beef, a pound all at once after you go to the gym and take on the physical resistance of the day.
You are gonna bubild up your mental and your physical strength. And one day you'll be able to bear the responsibility for yourself and others.
You'll actually be capable of starting a family and that's gonna feel great, but for right now you just walk in circles and that's all you have to do, that's it, that's the whole thing, be brave.
